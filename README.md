# 📧 **Spam Classifier – Machine Learning Web Application**

---

## 🔷 **📌 Project Overview**
This project is an end-to-end Spam Message Classification System built using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a Flask-based web interface. The system classifies a given text message as “Spam” or “Not Spam” based on a trained ML model.

The project covers the complete ML pipeline including:
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Model serialization  
- Web application development using Flask  

---

## 🔷 **📌 Problem Statement**
With the rapid increase in digital communication, spam messages have become a major issue. This project aims to automatically detect and filter spam messages using machine learning techniques to enhance security and user experience.

---

## 🔷 **📌 Tech Stack**

**Programming Language:**  
- Python  

**Libraries & Frameworks:**  
- Flask  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- NLTK / Regex (for text preprocessing)

**Machine Learning Model:**  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes  

**Text Representation:**  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  

**Frontend:**  
- HTML, CSS  

---

## 🔷 **📌 Dataset**
- Used a labeled dataset containing SMS messages categorized as:
  - `ham` → Not Spam  
  - `spam` → Spam  
- Dataset underwent cleaning and preprocessing before model training.

---

## 🔷 **📌 Data Preprocessing Steps**
1. Convert text to lowercase  
2. Remove special characters and punctuation  
3. Remove stopwords  
4. Tokenization  
5. Convert text into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**

---

## 🔷 **📌 Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Algorithm Used:** Multinomial Naive Bayes  
- **Train-Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing  

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Accuracy Score  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

---

## 🔷 **📌 Model Deployment**
- The trained model was serialized using `pickle`
- Integrated with a Flask web application
- Users can input a message via a web interface and receive real-time predictions

---

## 🔷 **📌 System Architecture**
User Input → Text Preprocessing → TF-IDF Vectorization → Trained ML Model → Prediction → Flask UI Output
